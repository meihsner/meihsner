# ðŸ‘‹ Hello! 
Iâ€™m @meihsner. I am a graduate of the Silesian University of Technology in the field of Biotechnology, specialization in Bioinformatics.
I started my adventure with programming at university, where I learned the basics of the Python language. Currently, I try to use it in all projects and develop towards computer vision,
image processing and gamedev.
# ðŸ“š What I'm currently learning?
I focus mainly on Python libraries, like: OpenCV, NumPy, matplotlib and several other libraries needed for projects that I come up with.
# ðŸ“§ How you can contact me?
Just send me an email at: ad.meihsner@gmail.com
